# VisualSnowWPF
This project was inspired by [this Reddit discussion](https://www.reddit.com/r/ItalyInformatica/comments/jrprun/fare_due_soldi_e_aiutare_chi_soffre_di_visualsnow/) (in italian).

This Windows WPF application displays a fullscreen semi-transparent image of a static noise (for now).

The goal is to create a semi-transparent overlay with an animated noise pattern to help reduce migraines caused by the [Visual snow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_snow) condition.

# Build instructions
To build the executable you only need Visual Studio; the solution file is inside the "Sources" folder.
